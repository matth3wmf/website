# DevOps Support Blog

DevOps practitioners often find themselves immersed in a deluge of support demands owing to the expansive nature of their work. The way support issues are managed often varies on the DevOps team type/format. 

Whether you approve or not, DevOps is commonly implemented as an established team, not just a set of philosophies, practices and tools within an organisation. [DevOps Topologies](https://web.devopstopologies.com/) is the best effort I have seen to formalise how "DevOps" is often implemented in reality.

In this post, I will discuss the best attempt I have seen to provide a "DevOps support function" that kept both reporters and DevOps practitioners happy.

### Assumptions

Although not a rule of thumb, the following is being assumed:

![DevOps Topology](../img/devops-topology.png "DevOps Topology"){: style="height:50%;width:50%;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"}

âœ… You have 10+ "DevOps practitioners" in your team

âœ… You have 50+ Developers/Testers who use your tooling with multiple daily support requests

âœ… You have an issue traker (e.g. Trello, Jira...)

âœ… Your users can report issues directly and can view updates/comments

âœ… You have the ability to communicate with your team daily (e.g. channels/threads, video call...)

âœ… Your team members accept that they have an occasional support function to fulfil and do so with empathy

If you can eventually answer yes to all the above then...

### Establish a Daily Support Triage

This is a meeting has the following criteria:

- A representative from each DevOps team or alternatively someone with enough team exposure to know the abilities of a given team
- Someone with visibility of upcoming work (the team have a non-support function too!)
- An up-to-date view/board of all support tickets (newly created, ongoing and done)
- Enough seniority/confidence to question/reject any given ticket
- A nominated lead for the meeting (i.e. Engineering Manager, round-robin attendees...)
- A timebox of 15 minutes (max!) for the entire meeting
- It **MUST** occur before all team daily stand-ups 
- A coffee is required 

### Setup a Support Board

Your support view/board should look similar to the following. Don't be overwhelmed by board/view creation...it's easier to think of them as a database query where the data is the tickets:

The definition of each column/swimlane is as follows:

- Triage Review - these ticket have been raised inbetween the previous daily triage call and now. It is the default ticket state/position when it has been created
- TODO - tickets that have been approved during the triage process and assigned to the relevant team based on some heuristic (e.g round-robbin, A/B team...)
- Blocked - tickets that have blocked with an explanation provided in the comments section
- In Progress - tickets currently being looked at by members of the DevOps team
- Done - Yay! ðŸ¥³

With the above in mind, the ticket transitions are as follows...

### Protect the Team!
The triage is the primary way to filter support requests and acts as the first line of defense.

This filtration protects the team from:

- Low priority work - everyone always thinks their work is the most important
- Invalid work - sometimes the requester is just wrong
- Poor requirements - if it can't be easily understood, reject it!
- Duplicate work - the attendees of the triage are the best people to identify duplicate effort

It's vital that all members of the team feel comfortable rejecting a ticket. Putting it on a never ending backlog rarely the answer.
